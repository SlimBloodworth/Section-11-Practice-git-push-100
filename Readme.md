### Continued development

There are 20 sections to this course, each with a number of lessons and exercises. This was originally an exercise from Section 6 - Working with Branches, however, for this particular repo I used it to practice with git push - Section 11, lesson 100. I am more than halfway through this course at this time and not every section has an exercise that could be, or needs to be added to a repository. I will add those exercises that are relevant as it will help solidify my understanding and better develop my skill through practice as I go along.
